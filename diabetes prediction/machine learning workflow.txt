Machine Learning WorkFlow tells us that how a machine learning model is 
going to be designed and how it is going to work with the real life data

the main aim is to produce the repeatable patterns in which it systmatically tranforms 
and processes the information to create prediction based solutions

the workflow goes with the following phases 
1)Asking the right Question-
    this phase basically defines the problem statement of what goal has to be achieved
    in simple words what are we suppose to do with it 

    this phase gives the requirements for the model consisting of 
    -->goals we want to achieve 
    -->the data we need 
    -->the process we can perform 

2)Preparing data-
    In this phase the raw data is collected and it is converted into the data which is required
    in simple words the cleaning up of the  data is done 

    what is done during the cleaning of the data
    -->removing of tha unwanted attributed
    -->removing of the usless record(records with no details)
    -->removing of the duplicate data 

3)Finding of the requirements in which the model is going to be trained-
    After the preperation of the data, the requirements are fetched from it which will be used for
    training the machine learning model.

4)Selecting the algorithm-
    This is a complex task.This phase is the selecting phase in based on the requirements for 
    training the model the algorithms are filtered according to it as there are many machine 
    learning algorithms 

    criteria on which the algorithms are selected
    -->what type of data is given (labelled or unlabelled)
    -->what is the size of the data  
    -->dimensionality of the data 
    -->Relationship between the data attributes
    -->interpretablity of the data
    -->which alogrithm is efficient in terms of computation time 


5)Training of the data-
    after the selection of the algorithm the Training of the model is done in which the 
    model learns the given output of the perticular data and stores its knowledge

6)Testing of the data-
    After the training phase of the model , a new data set is given and based on the knowledge 
    the model has gained during the training phase it predicts the outcome. 

    the following observation checked during this phase
    -->the accurateness of the prediction by the mode
    -->the adaptablity of the model 
    -->the dynamicness of the model 

7)Refinement of the model-
    this phse is called the backflow.This phase is invoked whenever the 
    model suffers the abnormalities in simple words the model is from suffering 
    hinderence as per the requirement which make the model to predict the inaccurate solutions

    Processes which are done for refinement of the model
    -->giving more training data to the model 
    -->change of the algorithm if required
    -->changing of the parameters 
    -->combinations of the above three processes
