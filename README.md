# Diabetes Predictor

This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical input data. The prediction model is built using a supervised machine learning algorithm and follows a structured machine learning workflow to ensure systematic processing of information and model accuracy.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **pima-data.csv** - The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model. This dataset contains medical information used to predict diabetes.
2. **machine learning workflow.txt** - A document explaining the phases involved in building a machine learning model, from problem definition to model refinement.
3. **diabetes predictor.ipynb** - A Jupyter Notebook that contains the implementation of the diabetes predictor model. It includes code for data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation.

## Machine Learning Workflow

The `machine learning workflow.txt` file describes the following phases of the machine learning process:

1. **Asking the Right Question**  
   Defines the problem statement and goals, helping to identify the data and processes needed for model development.

2. **Preparing Data**  
   Involves data cleaning, such as removing unnecessary attributes, useless records, and duplicate data.

3. **Finding Requirements for Model Training**  
   Extracts necessary requirements from the prepared data for training the machine learning model.

4. **Selecting the Algorithm**  
   Selects the appropriate algorithm based on the type of data, its size, dimensionality, relationships between attributes, and computational efficiency.

5. **Training the Data**  
   The model learns from the training data and stores its knowledge to make predictions.

6. **Testing the Data**  
   Evaluates the model's accuracy, adaptability, and dynamic performance using a new dataset.

7. **Refinement of the Model**  
   This phase involves improving the model's performance through additional training, algorithm changes, parameter adjustments, or a combination of these.

## How to Run the Project

1. Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
