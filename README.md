# Diabetes Predictor

This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical input data. The prediction model is built using a supervised machine learning algorithm and follows a structured machine learning workflow to ensure systematic processing of information and model accuracy.

## Project Files

The project consists of the following files:

1. **pima-data.csv**  
   - The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.
   - It contains various medical features that are used to predict diabetes outcomes.

2. **machine learning workflow.txt**  
   - This document describes the phases involved in building the machine learning model.
   - It covers steps from defining the problem to refining the model, ensuring that a repeatable workflow is followed.

3. **diabetes_predictor.ipynb**  
   - A Jupyter Notebook that contains the implementation of the diabetes predictor model.
   - Includes code for data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation.

## Machine Learning Workflow

The `machine learning workflow.txt` file describes the following phases of the machine learning process:

1. **Asking the Right Question**  
   Defines the problem statement and goals, helping to identify the data and processes needed for model development.

2. **Preparing Data**  
   Involves data cleaning, such as removing unnecessary attributes, useless records, and duplicate data.

3. **Finding Requirements for Model Training**  
   Extracts necessary requirements from the prepared data for training the machine learning model.

4. **Selecting the Algorithm**  
   Selects the appropriate algorithm based on the type of data, its size, dimensionality, relationships between attributes, and computational efficiency.

5. **Training the Data**  
   The model learns from the training data and stores its knowledge to make predictions.

6. **Testing the Data**  
   Evaluates the model's accuracy, adaptability, and dynamic performance using a new dataset.

7. **Refinement of the Model**  
   This phase involves improving the model's performance through additional training, algorithm changes, parameter adjustments, or a combination of these.

## How to Run the Project

1. Open the `diabetes_predictor.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the notebook to train the model and predict whether a patient has diabetes based on the input data.

## Conclusion

The Diabetes Predictor project is a comprehensive implementation of a machine learning workflow, aimed at producing a reliable predictive model. It demonstrates the full cycle from data preparation to model refinement, making it adaptable to future improvements.
